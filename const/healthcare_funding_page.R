Latest funding figures for England

The REAL Centre explores the latest health care funding figures for England. This includes how the funding figures compare to historical levels and how it stacks up against what is needed to meet the pressures facing health services. 
This page was originally published on 20 March 2023 and is updated at every fiscal event. This analysis is based on the [add relevant OBR forecast] from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) and [add relevant Treasury figures]. 
All growth rates are presented in real terms (2024/25 (or whichever relevant) prices).
Key points

•	Over the next 2 years, planned DHSC total spending is projected to grow from £188.5bn in cash terms to £214.1bn, which will translate to a real-terms increase of 3.8% per year.
•	Incorporating in-year budget transfers to DHSC in 2023/24, this would be a real-terms increase in overall funding of 3.7% per year, very close to the long-term growth rate (3.8%) and well above the growth rate between 2010 and 2019 (1.4%). 
•	Planned day-to-day DHSC spending will increase from £177.9bn in cash terms in 2023/24 to £200.5bn in 2025/26. Adjusting only for changes in pensions policy, this would result in a real-terms increase of 3.3% per year. 
•	Over the same period, the DHSC capital budget will increase from £10.5bn in cash terms to £13.6bn which would translate to a real-terms increase of 10.9% per year.
•	NHS England’s budget, after adjusting for pensions and internal transfers from DHSC to NHS England during 2023/24, is projected to see a real-terms increase of 3.0% per year.
•	Adjusting for population increases, the real-terms annual growth in NHS spending from 2023/24 to 2025/26 is 2.0% per person, and 1.7% per person when also adjusted for the ageing population.
•	Like other government departments, DHSC and the NHS have been set a productivity improvement target of 2%. This is well above the long-term average rate of productivity improvement of 0.6% and will be challenging to meet given NHS productivity is still lower than it was before the pandemic.  

How much funding has been committed to health care?

The Department of Health and Social Care’s overall budget (known as DHSC TDEL) sets the limit on overall health funding in England. It is made up of revenue (RDEL) and capital (CDEL) funding. RDEL refers to the funding allocated to day-to-day running costs. More than 90% of DHSC funding goes to NHS England to pay for its day-to-day running costs, including for staff pay and medicines. The remaining DHSC revenue funding covers a range of other programmes, including the cost of health care staff education and training and local government public health services. CDEL refers to the capital funding used to finance long-term investments, such as buildings and medical equipment. 
The 2024 Autumn Budget set new funding plans for DHSC in 2025/26 and updated the planned spend for 2024/25 following the most recent Supplementary estimates (the mechanism by which government departments request additional in-year funding from parliament). 
Table 1 shows the nominal figures (cash) and real figures (adjusted for inflation) by type of DHSC budget (RDEL, CDEL and TDEL) from 2023/24 to 2025/26.

The Autumn Budget confirmed planned DHSC TDEL of £201.9bn in 2024/25, made up of RDEL (£190.1bn) and CDEL (£11.8 bn). This is £13.4bn higher than announced in the Spring Budget. Out of the £190.1 bn DHSC RDEL, £181.4 bn is for the day-to-day running of NHS England.
Between 2023/24 and 2025/26, the total budget for health care is projected to see a real-terms increase of 3.7% per year. Planned RDEL and CDEL spend are projected to rise by 3.3% and 10.9% respectively.

How does funding compare to historical levels?

Figure 1 shows the real-terms growth rates in total health care funding over the past 40 years. The planned increase in funding over the next two years (3.7%) is slightly below the pre-Covid long-term average (3.8%). However, it is the highest year-on-year rise in funding since 2010 excluding COVID-19 and is higher than the average annual growth rate of 1.4% in the decade before the pandemic (from 2010 to 2019).

Is funding enough to meet the pressures facing the health services?

Figure 2 illustrates the impact of adjusting for inflation and changes to the population size and age structure on the NHS spending growth rate per year. Since 2013/14, the real-terms growth rate in NHS spending is 3.1% per year.
Health care use typically increases with age. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) recently revised its population estimates upwards. The population of England is now projected to be 2.0% higher in 2025/26 than in 2023/24 (1.0% growth per year), with a rising share of the population above retirement age. Currently, planned NHS spend per head announced in the Autumn Budget is projected to grow by 1.7% per year from 2023/24 to 2025/26 after accounting for both population growth and ageing. This is lower than the real-terms growth rate of 2.2% from 2013/14 to 2023/24, but higher than the pre-pandemic trend (1.0% from 2013/14 to 2018/19).

Conclusion

The additional funding announced for this year and next will help to stabilise services and could enable the government to make some progress on its ambitions for the NHS. The increase in capital investment is particularly welcome and begins to reverse years of underinvestment that has reduced NHS productivity and resulted in a spiralling backlog of maintenance and repairs. 
However, several unknowns remain, including the impact of future staff pay increases and the extent to which the government will cover the cost of the rise to employer’s National Insurance contributions. This could yet reduce the spending power of the additional funding announced and have a substantial impact on the 2025/26 budget. 
More broadly, these funding increases will need to be sustained throughout the rest of the parliament and beyond to meet rising demand and deliver improvements to services. Improving productivity will also need to be a key focus to ensure the new funding stretches as far as possible and to meet a challenging productivity target.
The focus now shifts to next year’s Spending Review and the government’s 10-year health plan to deliver the investment and reform needed to meet the government’s ambitions to improve the NHS.
