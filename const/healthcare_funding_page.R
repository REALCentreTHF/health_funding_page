Latest funding figures for England

The REAL Centre explores the latest health care funding figures for England. This includes how the funding figures compare to historical levels and how it stacks up against what is needed to meet the pressures facing health services. 

This page was originally published on 20 March 2023 and is updated at every fiscal event. All growth rates are presented in real terms {{baseline_year}} prices.

Key points

•	Over the next 2 years, planned DHSC total spending is projected to grow from {{cash_values_dhsc_tdel_2023}} in cash terms to {{cash_values_dhsc_tdel_2025}}, which will translate to a real-terms increase of {{real_values_dhsc_tdel_2023_2025_cagr}} per year.

•	Incorporating in-year budget transfers to DHSC in 2023/24, this would be a real-terms increase in overall funding of 3.7% per year, very close to the long-term growth rate {{3.8}} and well above the growth rate between 2010 and 2019 (1.4%). 

•	Planned day-to-day DHSC spending will increase from {{cash_values_dhsc_rdel_2023}} in cash terms in 2023/24 to {{cash_values_dhsc_rdel_2025}} in 2025/26. Adjusting only for changes in pensions policy, this would result in a real-terms increase of {{real_values_dhsc_rdel_2023_2025_cagr}} per year. 

•	Over the same period, the DHSC capital budget will increase from {{cash_values_cdel_2023}} in cash terms to {{cash_values_dhsc_rdel_2025}} which would translate to a real-terms increase of {{real_values_cdel_2023_2025_cagr}} per year.

•	NHS England’s budget, after adjusting for pensions and internal transfers from DHSC to NHS England during 2023/24, is projected to see a real-terms increase of {{real_values_nhse_rdel_2023_2025_cagr}} per year.
•	Adjusting for population increases, the real-terms annual growth in NHS spending from 2023/24 to 2025/26 is 2.0% per person, and 1.7% per person when also adjusted for the ageing population.

•	Like other government departments, DHSC and the NHS have been set a productivity improvement target of 2%. This is well above the long-term average rate of productivity improvement of 0.6% and will be challenging to meet given NHS productivity is still lower than it was before the pandemic.'
