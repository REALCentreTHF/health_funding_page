funding_page <- "How much funding has been committed to health care?

The Department of Health and Social Care’s overall budget (known as DHSC TDEL) sets the limit on overall health funding in England. It is made up of revenue (RDEL) and capital (CDEL) funding. The {{ current_budget_name }} set new funding plans for DHSC in {{ final_budget_year }} {{ updated_planned_figures }} following the most recent Supplementary Estimates (the mechanism by which government departments request additional in-year funding from parliament). {{additional_issues}}

The Autumn Budget confirmed planned DHSC TDEL of {{current_budget_year_dhsc_tdel}} in {{ current_budget_year }}. {{current_dhsc_tdel_minus_last_budget_dhsc_tdel}}. The planned budget for {{final_budget_year}} is {{end_year_dhsc_tdel}}, an increase of {{end_year_dhsc_tdel_minus_current_budget_year}} compared with {{current_budget_year}}. Once this is adjusted for inflation and in-year budget transfers are incorporated, the average annual increase is {{ annual_dhsc_tdel_cagr }} in real terms.

Day-to-day funding

More than {{percent_nhs_tdel}} of DHSC funding goes to NHS England to pay for the day-to-day running costs of the NHS, including for staff pay and medicines. Planned NHSE RDEL is {{current_budget_year_nhs_rdel}} in {{current_budget_year}} up {{current_nhs_rdel_minus_last_budget_nhs_rdel}} from planned funding in the {{last_budget_name}}. The average annual growth in NHS England’s budget between {{previous_budget_year}} and {{final_budget_year}} is {{annual_nhs_rdel_cagr}}
The remaining DHSC revenue funding covers a range of other programmes, including the cost of health care staff education and training and local government public health services.

Capital funding

Capital funding is used to finance long-term investments, such as buildings and medical equipment. The planned capital budget for health is {{current_budget_year_capital_budget}} in {{current_budget_year}}, up from {{current_dhsc_cdel_minus_previous_budget_year}} in {{previous_budget_year}}. This is {{current_dhsc_cdel_minus_previous_budget_dhsc_cdel}} than what was announced in the {{old_budget_name}} following in-year transfers to other budgets. However, the capital budget will rise to {{end_year_dhsc_cdel_budget}} in {{final_budget_year}}, a {{annual_dhsc_cdel_cagr}} % average annual real-terms change compared with {{previous_budget_year}}.

Figure 1 shows the actual and planned spend for total DHSC funding, as well as for NHS England and other health and capital budgets. Figures are presented in nominal terms without and with adjustment and in real terms.

Figure 2 shows a longer term breakdown of what the DHSC total budget is spent on and how this has changed since 2013/14.

How does funding compare to historical levels?

Incorporating in-year transfers to DHSC in {{previous_budget_year}}, total health funding (DHSC TDEL) will rise by an average of {{annual_dhsc_tdel_cagr}} per year in real terms between {{previous_budget_year}} and {{final_budget_year}}. As shown in Figure 3, this is slightly below the pre-COVID long-term average in England of {{long_term_dhsc_tdel_cagr}} (from 1979/80 to 2019/20). {{comment_on_funding_historical_comparison}}

For NHS England, looking back, the budget for NHS England’s day-to-day running costs (NHSE RDEL) will have grown by {{long_term_nhs_rdel_cagr}}% per year since 2013/14 compared with the {{annual_nhs_rdel_cagr}}% annual change between {{previous_budget_year}} and {{final_budget_year}}

Is funding enough to meet the pressures facing the health services?

Figure 4 illustrates the impact of adjusting for inflation and population size and age on the average annual rate of growth in NHS funding. Since 2013/14 the average annual growth rate for NHS spending is 3.1%.
Health care use typically increases with age. The ONS recently revised its population estimates upwards. The population of England is now projected to be {{england_pop_percent_change}}% higher in {{final_budget_year}} than in {{previous_budget_year}} ({{england_pop_growth}}% growth per year), with a rising share of the population above retirement age. Currently, the planned spend per head announced in the Autumn Budget is projected to grow by {{spend_per_head_change}}% from {{current_budget_year}} to {{final_budget_year}} after population growth and ageing is accounted for. This is lower than the real-terms growth rate of 2.2% from 2013/14 to 2023/24, but higher than the pre-pandemic trend (1.0% from 2013/14 to 2018/19)."
