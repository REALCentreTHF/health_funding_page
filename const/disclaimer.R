disclaimer <- "This data contains the following sources:

1. Departmental Spending data from the {{latest_pesa_year}} PESA release,
2. OBR Population Projections from {{latest_pop_proj_year}},
3. OBR Mid-Year Population estimates from {{latest_pop_year}},
4. GDP Deflator from the OBR's {{latest_efo_month}} EFO release,
5. Planned Budgetary from the {{latest_budget_name}},
6. Age-Cost Curves from the OBR's {{latest_efo_month}} EFR release

Whilst care has been made to ensure dates are aligned, occasionally some sources use fiscal mid-year estimates whilst others use calender mid-year estimates. This is not expected to have any major impact on any of the analyses presented herein

Additionally, there are several intra-departmental transfers that occur within the current period. These are accounted for in the current DHSC figures.

Unless stated, all values are in {{baseline_year}} year real-term prices."
