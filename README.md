# Health care funding page

## Overview

This repository contains code to produce the [health care funding page](https://www.health.org.uk/reports-and-analysis/analysis/health-care-funding) produced by the REAL Centre. The page is built using a jinjaR-based template, with data updated after every fiscal event.

The most recent update of the health care funding page took place in December 2025 to reflect the latest spending figures published as part of the Autumn Budget 2025.

## Backlog
- Revisit long-run average in Figure 3 to be potentially inclusive of COVID
- Change Figure 3 to focus on DHSC rather than NHS funding (given the upcoming abolition of NHS England, so budget documents no longer contain a separate line for NHS England RDEL)
- Discuss with Nuffield Trust and King's Fund to develop a consistent cross-organisation approach going into the next budget event in March 2026.
